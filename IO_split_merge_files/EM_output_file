In the last two chapters you have read about the landforms and the drainage ofour country.  
These are the two of the threebasic elements that one learns about the natural environment of any area.  
In this chapter you will learn about the third, that is, the atmospheric conditions that prevail over ourcountry.  
Why do we wear woollens in December or why it is hot and uncomfortable in the monthof May, and why it rains in June - July?  
Theanswers to all these questions can be found out by studying about the climate of India. 
Climate refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a large area fora long period of time (more than thirty years).Weather refers to the state of the atmosphereover an area at any point of time.  
The elements of weather and climate are the same, i.e.temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind,humidity and precipitation.  
You may have observed that the weather conditions fluctuate very often even within a day.  
But there is some common pattern over a few weeks or months,i.e.  ; days are cool or hot, windy or calm, cloudyor bright, and wet or dry.  
On the basis of the generalised monthly atmospheric conditions,the year is divided into seasons such as winter,summer or rainy seasons. 
The world is divided into a number of climatic regions.  
Do you know what type of climate India has and why it is so?  
We will learn about it in this chapter. 
• The word monsoon is derived from the Arabic word ‘mausim’ whichliterally means season.• ‘Monsoon’ refers to the seasonal reversal in thewind direction during a year. 
The climate of India is described as the‘monsoon’ type.  
In Asia, this type of climateis found mainly in the south and the southeast.Despite an overall unity in the general pattern,there are perceptible regional variations in climatic conditions within the country.  
Let ustake two important elements – temperature and precipitation, and examine how they vary from place to place and season to season. 
In summer, the mercury occasionallytouches 50°C in some parts of the Rajasthan desert, whereas it may be around 20°C in Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir.  
On a winternight, temperature at Drass in Jammu andKashmir may be as low as minus 45°C.Thiruvananthapuram, on the other hand, mayhave a temperature of 22°C. 
In certain places there is awide difference between day and night temperatures.  
In the Thar Desert the daytemperature may rise to 50°C, and drop downto near 15°C the same night.  
On the other hand,there is hardly any difference in day and nighttemperatures in the Andaman and Nicobarislands or in Kerala. 
Let us now look at precipitation.  
There arevariations not only in the form and types ofprecipitation but also in its amount and theseasonal distribution.  
While precipitation ismostly in the form of snowfall in the upper partsof Himalayas, it rains over the rest of thecountry.  
The annual precipitation varies fromover 400 cm in Meghalaya to less than 10 cmin Ladakh and western Rajasthan.  
Most partsof the country receive rainfall from June toSeptember.  ; But some parts like the Tamil Naducoast gets a large portion of its rain duringOctober and November. 
In general, coastal areas experience lesscontrasts in temperature conditions.  
Seasonalcontrasts are more in the interior of thecountry.  
There is decrease in rainfall generally from east to west in the Northern Plains.  
Thesevariations have given rise to variety in lives ofpeople – in terms of the food they eat, theclothes they wear and also the kind of housesthey live in. 
Why the houses in Rajasthan have thickwalls and flat roofs?• Why is it that the houses in the Tarai region andin Goa and Mangalore have sloping roofs?• Why houses in Assam are built on stilts? 
CLIMATIC CONTROLS 
There are six major controls of the climate ofany place.  ; They are: latitude, altitude,pressure and wind system, distance fromthe sea (continentality), ocean currents andrelief features. 
Due to the curvature of the earth, theamount of solar energy received variesaccording to latitude.  
As a result, airtemperature generally decreases from theequator towards the poles.  
As one goes fromthe surface of the earth to higher altitudes,the atmosphere becomes less dense andtemperature decreases.  
The hills are thereforecooler during summers.  
The pressure andwind system of any area depend on thelatitude and altitude of the place.  
Thus itinfluences the temperature and rainfallpattern.  
The sea exerts a moderating influenceon climate: As the distance from the seaincreases, its moderating influence decreasesand the people experience extreme weatherconditions.  ; This condition is known ascontinentality (i.e.  
very hot during summersand very cold during winters).  
Ocean currentsalong with onshore winds affect the climate ofthe coastal areas, For example, any coastalarea with warm or cold currents flowing pastit, will be warmed or cooled if the winds areonshore. 
Why most of the world’s deserts arelocated in the western margins of continents in thesubtropics? 
Finally, relief too plays a major role indetermining the climate of a place.  
High mountainsact as barriers for cold or hot winds; they mayalso cause precipitation if they are high enoughand lie in the path of rain-bearing winds.  
Theleeward side of mountains remains relatively dry. 
FACTORS AFFECTING INDIA’S CLIMATE 
Latitude 
The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middleof the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in thewest to Mizoram in the east.  
Almost half of thecountry, lying south of the Tropic of Cancer,belongs to the tropical area.  
All the remainingarea, north of the Tropic, lies in the sub-tropics.Therefore, India’s climate has characteristics oftropical as well as subtropical climates. 
Altitude 
India has mountains to the north, which havean average height of about 6,000 metres.  
Indiaalso has a vast coastal area where themaximum elevation is about 30 metres.  
TheHimalayas prevent the cold winds from CentralAsia from entering the subcontinent.  
It isbecause of these mountains that thissubcontinent experiences comparativelymilder winters as compared to central Asia. 
Pressure and Winds 
The climate and associated weather conditionsin India are governed by the followingatmospheric conditions: 
Pressure and surface winds;Upper air circulation; andWestern cyclonic disturbances andtropical cyclones. 
India lies in the region of north easterlywinds.  
These winds originate from thesubtropical high-pressure belt of the northernhemisphere.  
They blow south, get deflected tothe right due to the Coriolis force, and moveon towards the equatorial low-pressure area.Generally, these winds carry very littlemoisture as they originate and blow over land.Therefore, they bring little or no rain.  
Hence,India should have been an arid land, but, it isnot so.  
Let us see why? 
Coriolis force: An apparent force caused by the earth’srotation.  
The Coriolis force is responsible for deflectingwinds towards the right in the northern hemisphereand towards the left in the southern hemisphere.  
Thisis also known as ‘Ferrel’s Law.’ 
The pressure and wind conditions overIndia are unique.  
During winter, there is ahigh-pressure area north of the Himalayas.Cold dry winds blow from this region to thelow-pressure areas over the oceans to thesouth.  
In summer, a low-pressure areadevelops over interior Asia as well as overnorthwestern India.  
This causes a completereversal of the direction of winds duringsummer.  
Air moves from the high-pressurearea over the southern Indian Ocean, in asouth-easterly direction, crosses the equator,and turns right towards the low-pressure areasover the Indian subcontinent.  
These are knownas the Southwest Monsoon winds.  
These windsblow over the warm oceans, gather moistureand bring widespread rainfall over themainland of India. 
The upper air circulation in this region isdominated by a westerly flow.  
An importantcomponent of this flow is the jet stream. 
These jet streams are located approximatelyover 27°-30° north latitude, therefore, they areknown as subtropical westerly jet streams.  
OverIndia, these jet streams blow south of the Himalayas, all through the year except insummer.  
The western cyclonic disturbancesexperienced in the north and north-western partsof the country are brought in by this westerlyflow.  
In summer, the subtropical westerly jetstream moves north of the Himalayas with theapparent movement of the sun.  
An easterly jetstream, called the sub-tropical easterly jet streamblows over peninsular India, approximately over14°N during the summer months. 
Jet stream: These are a narrow belt of highaltitude (above 12,000 m) westerly winds in thetroposphere.  
Their speed varies from about 110km/h in summer to about 184 km/h in winter.A number of separate jet streams have beenidentified.  
The most constant are the mid-latitudeand the sub tropical jet stream. 
The western cyclonic disturbances are weatherphenomena of the winter months brought in by thewesterly flow from the Mediterranean region.  
Theyusually influence the weather of the north andnorth-western regions of India.  
Tropical cyclonesoccur during the monsoon as well as in October -November, and are part of the easterly flow.  ; Thesedistrurbances affect the coastal regions of thecountry.  
Have you read or heard about thedisasters caused by them on Orissa and AndhraPradesh coast? 
THE INDIAN MONSOON 
The climate of India is strongly influenced bymonsoon winds.  
The sailors who came to Indiain historic times were one of the first to havenoticed the phenomenon of the monsoon.  
Theybenefited from the reversal of the wind systemas they came by sailing ships at the mercy ofwinds.  
The Arabs, who had also come to Indiaas traders named this seasonal reversal of thewind system ‘monsoon.’ 
The monsoons are experienced in thetropical area roughly between 20° N and 20°S.  
To understand the mechanism of themonsoons, the following facts are important. 
(a) The differential heating and cooling ofland and water creates low pressure on thelandmass of India while the seas aroundexperience comparatively high pressure. 
(b) The shift of the position of Inter TropicalConvergence Zone (ITCZ) in summer, overthe Ganga plain (this is the equatorial troughnormally positioned about 5°N of theequator.  
It is also known as the monsoon-trough during the monsoon season). 
(c) The presence of the high-pressure area,east of Madagascar, approximately at20°S over the Indian Ocean.  
The intensityand position of this high-pressure areaaffects the Indian Monsoon. 
(d) The Tibetan plateau gets intenselyheated during summer, which results instrong vertical air currents and theformation of low pressure over the plateauat about 9 km above sea level. 
(e) The movement of the westerly jet streamto the north of the Himalayas and thepresence of the tropical easterly jetstream over the Indian peninsula duringsummer. 
Inter Tropical Convergence ZoneThe Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ,) is abroad trough of low pressure in equatoriallatitudes.  
This is where the northeast and thesoutheast trade winds converge.  ; Thisconvergence zone lies more or less parallel tothe equator but moves north or south with theapparent movement of the sun. 
Apart from this, it has also been noticed thatchanges in the pressure conditions over thesouthern oceans also affect the monsoons.Normally when the tropical eastern south PacificOcean experiences high pressure, the tropicaleastern Indian Ocean experiences low pressure.But in certain years, there is a reversal in thepressure conditions and the eastern Pacific haslower pressure in comparison to the easternIndian Ocean.  
This periodic change in pressureconditions is known as the SouthernOscillation or SO.  
The difference in pressureover Tahiti (Pacific Ocean, 18°S/149°W) andDarwin in northern Australia (Indian Ocean,12°30’S/131°E) is computed to predict theintensity of the monsoons.  
If the pressuredifferences were negative, it would mean belowaverage and late monsoons.  
A feature connectedwith the SO is the El Nino phenomenon in whicha warm ocean current that flows past thePeruvian Coast, in place of the cold Peruviancurrent, every 2 to 5 years.  
The changes inpressure conditions are connected to the El Nino.Hence, the phenomenon is referred to as ENSO(El Nino Southern Oscillations). 
El Nino: This is a name given to the periodicdevelopment of a warm ocean current along thecoast of Peru as a temporary replacement of thecold Peruvian current.  
‘El Nino’ is a Spanish wordmeaning ‘the child’, and refers to the baby Christ,as this current starts flowing during Christmas.The presence of the El Nino leads to an increasein sea-surface temperatures and weakening ofthe trade winds in the region. 
THE ONSET OF THE MONSOON AND WITHDRAWAL 
The Monsoon, unlike the trades, are not steadywinds but are pulsating in nature, affected bydifferent atmospheric conditions encounteredby it, on its way over the warm tropical seas.The duration of the monsoon is between 100-120 days from early June to mid-September.Around the time of its arrival, the normalrainfall increases suddenly and continuesconstantly for several days.  
This is known asthe ‘burst’ of the monsoon, and can bedistinguished from the pre-monsoon showers.The monsoon arrives at the southern tip of theIndian peninsula generally by the first week ofJune.  
Subsequently, it proceeds into two – theArabian Sea branch and the Bay of Bengalbranch.  
The Arabian Sea branch reachesMumbai about ten days later onapproximately the 10 th of June.  
This is a fairlyrapid advance.  
The Bay of Bengal branch alsoadvances rapidly and arrives in Assam in thefirst week of June.  
The lofty mountains causesthe monsoon winds to deflect towards the westover the Ganga plains.  
By mid-June theArabian Sea branch of the monsoon arrivesover Saurashtra-Kuchchh and the central partof the country.  
The Arabian Sea and the Bayof Bengal branches of the monsoon merge overthe northwestern part of the Ganga plains.Delhi generally receives the monsoon showersfrom the Bay of Bengal branch by the end ofJune (tentative date is 29 th of June).  
By the firstweek of July, western Uttar Pradesh, Punjab,Haryana and eastern Rajasthan experience themonsoon.  
By mid-July, the monsoon reachesHimachal Pradesh and the rest of the country(Figure 4.3). 
Withdrawal or the retreat of the monsoonis a more gradual process (Figure 4.4).  ; Thewithdrawal of the monsoon begins innorthwestern states of India by earlySeptember.  
By mid-October, it withdrawscompletely from the northern half of thepeninsula.  
The withdrawal from the southernhalf of the peninsula is fairly rapid.  
By earlyDecember, the monsoon has withdrawn fromthe rest of the country. 
The islands receive the very first monsoonshowers, progressively from south to north,from the last week of April to the first week ofMay.  
The withdrawal, takes place progressivelyfrom north to south from the first week ofDecember to the first week of January.  
By thistime the rest of the country is already underthe influence of the winter monsoon. 
THE SEASONS 
The monsoon type of climate is characterisedby a distinct seasonal pattern.  
The weatherconditions greatly change from one season tothe other.  
These changes are particularlynoticeable in the interior parts of the country.The coastal areas do not experience muchvariation in temperature though there isvariation in rainfall pattern.  
How many seasonsare experienced in your place?  
Four mainseasons can be identified in India – the coldweather season, the hot weather season, theadvancing monsoon and the retreatingmonsoon with some regional variations. 
The Cold Weather Season (Winter) 
The cold weather season begins from mid-November in northern India and stays tillFebruary.  
December and January are the coldestmonths in the northern part of India.  
Thetemperature decreases from south to the north.The average temperature of Chennai, on theeastern coast, is between 24° - 25° Celsius, whilein the northern plains, it ranges between 10° -15° Celsius.  
Days are warm and nights are cold.Frost is common in the north and the higherslopes of the Himalayas experience snowfall. 
During this season, the northeast tradewinds prevail over the country.  
They blow fromland to sea and hence, for most part of thecountry, it is a dry season.  
Some amount ofrainfall occurs on the Tamil Nadu coast fromthese winds as, here they blow from sea to land. 
In the northern part of the country, a feeblehigh-pressure region develops, with light windsmoving outwards from this area.  
Influenced bythe relief, these winds blow through the Gangavalley from the west and the northwest.  
Theweather is normally marked by clear sky, lowtemperatures and low humidity and feeble,variable winds. 
A characteristic feature of the cold weatherseason over the northern plains is the inflow ofcyclonic disturbances from the west and thenorthwest.  
These low-pressure systems,originate over the Mediterranean Sea andwestern Asia and move into India, along withthe westerly flow.  
They cause the much-neededwinter rains over the plains and snowfall in themountains.  
Although the total amount ofwinter rainfall locally known as ‘mahawat’ issmall, they are of immense importance for thecultivation of ‘rabi’ crops. 
The peninsular region does not have a well-defined cold season.  
There is hardly anynoticeable seasonal change in temperaturepattern during winters due to the moderatinginfluence of the sea. 
The Hot Weather Season (Summer) 
Due to the apparent northward movement of thesun, the global heat belt shifts northward.  
Assuch, from March to May, it is hot weather seasonin India.  
The influence of the shifting of the heatbelt can be seen clearly from temperaturerecordings taken during March-May at differentlatitudes.  
In March, the highest temperature isabout 38° Celsius, recorded on the Deccanplateau.  
In April, temperatures in Gujarat andMadhya Pradesh are around 42° Celsius.  
In May,temperature of 45° Celsius is common in thenorthwestern parts of the country.  
In peninsularIndia, temperatures remain lower due to themoderating influence of the oceans. 
The summer months experience risingtemperature and falling air pressure in thenorthern part of the country.  
Towards the endof May, an elongated low-pressure areadevelops in the region extending from the TharDesert in the northwest to Patna andChotanagpur plateau in the east andsoutheast.  
Circulation of air begins to set inaround this trough. 
A striking feature of the hot weather seasonis the ‘loo.’  
These are strong, gusty, hot, drywinds blowing during the day over the north andnorthwestern India.  
Sometimes they evencontinue until late in the evening.  
Direct exposureto these winds may even prove to be fatal.  
Duststorms are very common during the month ofMay in northern India.  
These storms bringtemporary relief as they lower the temperatureand may bring light rain and cool breeze.  ; This isalso the season for localised thunderstorms,associated with violent winds, torrentialdownpours, often accompanied by hail.  
In WestBengal, these storms are known as the ‘KaalBaisakhi.’ 
Towards the close of the summer season,pre-monsoon showers are common especially,in Kerala and Karnataka.  
They help in the earlyripening of mangoes, and are often referred toas ‘mango showers.’ 
By early June, the low-pressure condition overthe northern plains intensifies.  
It attracts, thetrade winds of the southern hemisphere.  
Thesesouth-east trade winds originate over thewarm subtropical areas of the southern oceans.They cross the equator and blow in a south-westerly direction entering the Indian peninsulaas the south-west monsoon.  
As these windsblow over warm oceans, they bring abundantmoisture to the subcontinent.  
These winds arestrong and blow at an average velocity of 30km per hour.  
With the exception of the extremenorth-west, the monsoon winds cover thecountry in about a month. 
The inflow of the south-west monsoon intoIndia brings about a total change in theweather.  
Early in the season, the windwardside of the Western Ghats receives very heavyrainfall, more than 250 cm.  
The DeccanPlateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh alsoreceive some amount of rain in spite of lyingin the rain shadow area.  
The maximum rainfallof this season is received in the north-easternpart of the country.  
Mawsynram in thesouthern ranges of the Khasi Hills receives thehighest average rainfall in the world.  
Rainfallin the Ganga valley decreases from the east tothe west.  ; Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat getscanty rainfall. 
Another phenomenon associated with themonsoon is its tendency to have ‘breaks’ inrainfall.  
Thus, it has wet and dry spells.  
Inother words, the monsoon rains take placeonly for a few days at a time.  
They are interspersed with rainless intervals.  
Thesebreaks in monsoon are related to themovement of the monsoon trough.  
Forvarious reasons, the trough and its axis keepon moving northward or southward, whichdetermines the spatial distribution of rainfall.When the axis of the monsoon trough lies overthe plains, rainfall is good in these parts.  
Onthe other hand, whenever the axis shifts closerto the Himalayas, there are longer dry spellsin the plains, and widespread rain occur inthe mountainous catchment areas of theHimalayan rivers.  
These heavy rains bring intheir wake, devastating floods causingdamage to life and property in the plains.  
Thefrequency and intensity of tropicaldepressions too, determine the amount andduration of monsoon rains.  
Thesedepressions form at the head of the Bay ofBengal and cross over to the mainland.  
Thedepressions follow the axis of the “monsoontrough of low pressure”.  
The monsoon isknown for its uncertainties.  
The alternationof dry and wet spells vary in intensity,frequency and duration.  
While it causes heavyfloods in one part, it may be responsible fordroughts in the other.  
It is often irregular inits arrival and its retreat.  
Hence, it sometimesdisturbs the farming schedule of millions offarmers all over the country. 
Retreating/Post Monsoons(The Transition Season) 
During October-November, with the apparentmovement of the sun towards the south, themonsoon trough or the low-pressure troughover the northern plains becomes weaker.  
Thisis gradually replaced by a high-pressuresystem.  
The south-west monsoon windsweaken and start withdrawing gradually.  
Bythe beginning of October, the monsoonwithdraws from the Northern Plains.The months of October-November form aperiod of transition from hot rainy season todry winter conditions.  
The retreat of themonsoon is marked by clear skies and rise intemperature.  
While day temperatures arehigh, nights are cool and pleasant.  
The landis still moist.  
Owing to the conditions of hightemperature and humidity, the weatherbecomes rather oppressive during the day.This is commonly known as ‘October heat.’  
Inthe second half of October, the mercury beginsto fall rapidly in northern India. 
Mawsynram, the wettestplace on the earth is also reputed for itsstalagmite and stalactite caves ; The low-pressure conditions, over north-western India, get transferred to the Bay ofBengal by early November.  
This shift isassociated with the occurrence of cyclonicdepressions, which originate over theAndaman Sea.  
These cyclones generally crossthe eastern coasts of India cause heavy andwidespread rain.  
These tropical cyclones areoften very destructive.  
The thickly populateddeltas of the Godavari, the Krishna and theKaveri are frequently struck by cyclones, whichcause great damage to life and property.Sometimes, these cyclones arrive at the coastsof Orissa, West Bengal and Bangladesh.  
Thebulk of the rainfall of the Coromandel Coast isderived from depressions and cyclones. 
DISTRIBUTION OF RAINFALL 
Parts of western coast and northeastern Indiareceive over about 400 cm of rainfall annually.However, it is less than 60 cm in westernRajasthan and adjoining parts of Gujarat,Haryana and Punjab.  
Rainfall is equally lowin the interior of the Deccan plateau, and eastof the Sahyadris.  
Why do these regions receivelow rainfall?  
A third area of low precipitationis around Leh in Jammu and Kashmir.  
The restof the country receives moderate rainfall.Snowfall is restricted to the Himalayan region. 
Owing to the nature of monsoons, theannual rainfall is highly variable from year toyear.  
Variability is high in the regions of low rainfall such as parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat andthe leeward side of the Western Ghats.  
As such,while areas of high rainfall are liable to beaffected by floods, areas of low rainfall aredrought-prone (Figure 4.6 and 4.7). 
MONSOON AS UNIFYING BOND 
You have already known the way theHimalayas protect the subcontinent fromextremely cold winds from central Asia.  
Thisenables northern India to have uniformlyhigher temperatures when compared to otherareas on the same latitudes.  
Similarly, thepeninsular plateau, under the influence of thesea from three sides, has moderatetemperatures.  
Despite such moderatinginfluences, there are great variations in thetemperature conditions.  
Nevertheless, theunifying influence of the monsoon on theIndian subcontinent is quite perceptible.  
Theseasonal alteration of the wind systems andthe associated weather conditions provide arhythmic cycle of seasons.  
Even theuncertainties of rain and uneven distributionare very much typical of the monsoons.  
TheIndian landscape, its animal and plant life,its entire agricultural calendar and the life ofthe people, including their festivities, revolvearound this phenomenon.  
Year after year,people of India from north to south and fromeast to west, eagerly await the arrival of the monsoon.  
These monsoon winds bind thewhole country by providing water to set theagricultural activities in motion.  
The rivervalleys which carry this water also unite as asingle river valley unit.
